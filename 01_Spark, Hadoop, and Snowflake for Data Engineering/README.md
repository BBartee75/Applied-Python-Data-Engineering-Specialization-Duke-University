# Spark, Hadoop, and Snowflake for Data Engineering
About this Course
e.g. This is primarily aimed at first- and second-year undergraduates interested in engineering or science, along with high school students and professionals with an interest in programmingGain the skills for building efficient and scalable data pipelines. Explore essential data engineering platforms (Hadoop, Spark, and Snowflake) as well as learn how to optimize and manage them. Delve into Databricks, a powerful platform for executing data analytics and machine learning tasks, while honing your Python data science skills with PySpark. Finally, discover the key concepts of MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, and learn how to integrate it with Databricks.

This course is designed for learners who want to pursue or advance their career in data science or data engineering, or for software developers or engineers who want to grow their data management skill set. In addition to the technologies you will learn, you will also gain methodologies to help you hone your project management and workflow skills for data engineering, including applying Kaizen, DevOps, and Data Ops methodologies and best practices.
